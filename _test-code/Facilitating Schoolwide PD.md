<h1>Facilitating School-wide PD (#Organise_with_SLS)</h1>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>Teachers and the Professional Development (PD) committee can help to make
school-wide PD sessions seamless and easily accessible through Class Groups
in SLS.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>PD resources can be consolidated into Modules as a systematic way of conducting
PD sessions in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Groups can act as an aggregating platform where discussion and comments
can be accessed via the Forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using SLS for PD benefits you and your colleagues through familiarization
of the Class Group feature and increases confidence in using SLS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(New in R19)</em> The SLS Planner helps teachers and the PD committee
to plan ahead by attaching assignments or resources in a selected date
cell. Recurring events can also be created for PD sessions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create a Module or series of Modules for PD and organise them in a folder
in My Drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From <a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">your school PD Class Group, assign these Module(s)</a>,
with pre-defined Start and End dates, according to the PD schedule in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers (as Students) will be notified via SLS Announcements to complete
the assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the Monitor Assignment page, PD facilitators can bring up responses
for further discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers can <a href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/about-the-forum/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">extend their learning further by creating posts in the Class Group Forum</a> to
generate discussions.</p>
</li>

<p>Tip!</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create differentiated access to sections within the Module, such as by
department, by <a href="/teacher-user-guide/differentiate/create-subgroups/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">assigning Subgroups</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
