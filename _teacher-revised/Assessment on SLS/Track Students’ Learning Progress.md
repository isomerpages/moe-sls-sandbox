<h2>What it is</h2>

in and identify students who need more remediation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can click on specific questions or students to investigate specific
areas that the students are struggling in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HODs and SHs can identify broader clusters of learning gaps to plan structured
interventions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HODs and SHs can point to unexpected student performance and identify
if the cause is pedagogical, motivational, or professional, and correct
these issues early before summative assessments.</p>
</li>
