<h3>Why use SLS as a One-Stop Hub?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Using SLS as a One-Stop Hub has the following benefits for schools:</p>
<p>a. There are many <u>MOE T&amp;L resources and initiatives to be rolled out through SLS</u> in
the next few years, e.g. Interactive Digital Textbooks and e-SBA.</p>
<p>b. SLS's <u>T&amp;L features</u> are now comparable to the best-in-class
in other learning platforms. Additionally, SLS has introduced many AIEd
capabilities in line with Whole-Of-Government strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>c. SLS's <u>open policy</u> allows teachers and students to tap on a wider
variety of external tools (more than 200) through SLS, e.g. Google suite
and extensions.</p>
<p>d. SLS provides an <u>MOE-wide platform</u> for schools to collaborate with
one another, e.g. sharing of digitalised exam papers, conducting of interschool
classes such as in third language, or even to support Professional Learning
Communities.</p>
