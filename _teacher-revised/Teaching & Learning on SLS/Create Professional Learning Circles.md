<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>You can create a Class Group for various learning circles (within your
department and school; even interschool and interdivisional learning circles)
to share or consolidate resources.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Using a Class Group as a repository helps you and your colleagues to save
time as everyone can share, co-edit and curate resources together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Group Resources do not have a due date, so your colleagues can access
them anytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set professional boundaries as separate Class Groups can be created for
work with vendors or other teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/create-class-groups/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Add a new Class Group</a> on
the Class Groups page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Teachers into your Class Group and assign them with the necessary
roles (Owner, Co-Teachers, Liaison Teachers, Observers, or <a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/add-teachers-as-students-to-a-class-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Students</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate using the tabs to add various resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers in the Class Group can then access the resource and <a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/star-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">star the resources</a> or
activities they wish to save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To further organise your resources, you can <a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/manage-class-group-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">create Categories in the Resources tab</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
