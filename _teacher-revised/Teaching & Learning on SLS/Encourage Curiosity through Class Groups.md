<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>Extend learning in Class Groups and empower students to share their perspectives
by facilitating discussions in the Forum.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Many of us will experience "teachable moments" in the classroom. Use features
within the Class Group to extend these moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through organisation of resources in your Class Group, you can cater to
diverse students' learning needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources in Class Groups have no End Date, so students can use these
supplementary resources for self-study at their preferred pacing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In your <a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/manage-class-group-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Class Group</a>,
add supplementary resources from the MOE Library, Community Gallery, or
My Drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For clarity, consider organizing these resources into Categories so that
students can access them easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend your students' learning by inviting them to post questions and
ideas on the <a href="/teacher-user-guide/collaborate/about-the-forum/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Class Group Forum</a>.
You can even provide guidance by starting a Forum post or poll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enrich the discussion, encourage your students to comment on other
Forum posts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
