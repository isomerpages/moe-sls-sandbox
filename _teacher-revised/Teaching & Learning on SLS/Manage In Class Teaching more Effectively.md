<h1>Manage In Class Teaching more Effectively (#Enact_With_SLS)</h1>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>You can use SLS to support in-class teaching by enabling students to work
together on the same assignment or rewarding their good behavior.</p>
<h2>Why use it</h2>
<hr>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Encourage students to carry out live group discussions and submit it as
a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate gamified Modules with in-class teaching by manually awarding
XP, Game Story, and Achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a quick sensing of students' thoughts and opinions by getting them
to post in the Class Forum or doing a quick Poll in a Module.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Activity Teams</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teachers can choose to allow students to submit assignments as one team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When marking assignments in teams, feedback will also be given to the
team automatically, making it more convenient than assigning it to multiple
students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Award XP, Game Story, and Achievements Manually</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Encourage students to behave positively in class by awarding them XP or
creating Game Stories/Achievements for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weave physical activities into your gamified Modules and capture their
progress on SLS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forum/Poll</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teachers can create topics for students to respond to in the Forum tab
within their Class Group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers can also create a Poll as an activity within a Module for students
