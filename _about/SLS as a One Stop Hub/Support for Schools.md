<h2>Support for Schools</h2>
<p>It is recommended for schools to implement the various digital transformation
processes over 3 stages and 5 domains via a whole-school approach or to
start with certain department(s). Given that schools are at different stages
of readiness, schools can consider spending time to prepare the ground
for the implementation of SLS as a One-Stop Hub.</p>

<p>Schools can implement the processes by “three stages” or “five domains”;
whole- school or by departments</p>

<br>The four quadrants illustrate the approach that schools might take given
school’s context i.e. readiness, culture, priorities vis-à-vis the benefits
of SLS as a One-Stop Hub that schools can reap.</p>
<p>Schools are recommended to embark on quadrant 2 i.e. whole-school approach
by three-stages. This enables schools to reap the maximum benefits as a
whole-school co-ordinated approach by stages will aid successful implementation.</p>
<p>Schools looking to introduce SLS as a One-Stop Hub quickly by having certain
department(s) start first might embark on quadrant 4. However, given that
departments may choose different domains to implement, there will be least
synergy especially if some departments do not implement any domains.</p>
<p>Schools looking for a whole-school approach yet preserve autonomy for
departments to decide the domains to implement, might embark on quadrant
1. This implies that implementation is confined to (discrete) department-selected
domains which does not bring significant synergies at the school-level.
Though this domain will get the whole school involved, schools will inevitably
still need to coordinate the respective departments’ efforts downstream
for successful implementation of SLS as a One-Stop Hub.</p>
<p>Schools looking for departments to implement SLS as a One-Stop Hub by
stages might embark on quadrant 3. Schools in this quadrant will establish
the foundation for SLS as a One-Stop Hub but reap limited benefits if the
three stages are not implemented fully. For example, if departments only
implement the processes in stage 1, school will not reap the full benefits
of using SLS for central administration of T&amp;L as processes such as
digitalising T&amp;L resources will not be implemented.</p>
