	SLS Launchpad is an event that aims to foster closer collaboration between SLS Office, MOE HQ, schools and teacher developers who are actively engaged in Edtech explorations. Through this session, we shared how the SLS supports the EdTech ecosystem, planned builds for SLS version 2, as well as some innovation projects that are integrated with the platform.

<p>
	The session was held on 29 May 2024 at MOE Balestier and was jointly organised by the SLS Office and Classroom of the Future (CotF).
