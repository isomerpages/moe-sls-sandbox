<h1>Empower Students to be Self Directed Learners (#Self_Study_With_SLS)</h1>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are different tools that you can use to guide students in their
self-study.</p>
<h2>Why do it</h2>
<hr>
<p>We can encourage students to be independent and self-directed learners
by providing them with a platform where they can have access to ample resources
for self-study.</p>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>(New in R19)</em> The Self-Study List helps students take control of
their own learning by consolidating their self-study attempts into one
list for easy tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can share resources from the MOE Library, Community Gallery, and My
Drive with your students in <a href="/teacher-user-guide/organise/manage-class-group-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Class Groups, under the Resources tab</a>.</p>
