<h1>Jigsaw Activities for Teamwork (#Collaborate_With_SLS)</h1>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<hr>
<p>You can encourage collaboration and group work by assigning a Team Quiz
for students to answer as a team.</p>
<h2>Why use it</h2>
<hr>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students can work in teams asynchronously or in real-time on the same
Quiz submission, receive marks and feedback as a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the Team Quiz, collaboration is brought about through meaningful
discussions as students arrive at a common team response.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<hr>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create an engaging Team Quiz by applying strategies that encourage team
spirit. In this example, we will apply the Jigsaw Technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create Activities in a Module with preselected reading materials for each

Activity A and so forth. <a href="/teacher-user-guide/enact/change-access-to-activities/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Edit the Activity Access so that students can only see materials for their role</a>.</p>
